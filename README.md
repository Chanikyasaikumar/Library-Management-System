**🏛️ Library Management System**
A robust, full-stack web application designed to manage library operations, including user access control, book cataloging, and automated fine calculation. This project demonstrates proficiency in RESTful API design and Object-Oriented Design (OOD).



✨ Key Features & Achievements
Scalable Architecture: Engineered the application using Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles, implementing distinct classes for user types (Admin, Librarian, Member) to enable secure, role-based access control.

100% Automation: Integrated a custom module for automated fine calculation and transaction logging, successfully reducing manual tracking efforts by 100%.

Robust Backend: Designed and implemented scalable RESTful APIs using Python/Flask to handle over 1,000 daily transactions while maintaining 99% uptime in the internship environment.

Dynamic UI: Developed a responsive and accessible user interface using Jinja templates, HTML, and CSS.
